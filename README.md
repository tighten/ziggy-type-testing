**Test environment for [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) types**

This repo contains files that can be used to test and experiment with Ziggy's TypeScript type definitions.

**Usage**

Open this project in VS Code or any other IDE/editor with integrated TypeScript intellisense/linting.

**Files**

| File | Analogue in `tighen/ziggy` repo | Analogue in a real app | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `index.js` | | Any app code using `route()` | Initially used for testing autocompletion, probably no longer necessary. |
| `index.ts` | | Any app code using `route()` | Used for testing autocompletion and type checking. TypeScript will lint/check this file, so it's basically this repo's testsâ€”it should contain extensive examples of real usage of Ziggy to verify that specific cases don't (or do) produce type errors or provide the expected autocomplete options. |
| `route.d.ts` | `src/js/index.d.ts` | | Type definitions for Ziggy. This file should be an exact copy of Ziggy's `index.d.ts`, and can be used to tweak and experiment with different types. The effects of changes to this file can be tested using `index.ts`, and changes to it that we want to keep should be PRed back to Ziggy. |
| `route.js` | `src/js/index.js` | Ziggy itself | A fake `route()` function so the other files can import something. |
| `Router.js` | `src/js/Router.js` | | A fake `Router` to test method autocompletion with, may no longer be necessary. |
| `ziggy.d.ts` | | Ziggy-generated `ziggy.d.ts` file | A list of routes to use for autocompletion. |
| `ziggy.js` | | Ziggy-generated route file | A fake Ziggy config for testing/reference, this may not actually be in use or necessary. |
